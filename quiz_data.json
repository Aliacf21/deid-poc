      "question": "A 46-year-old male with extensive travel to Southeast Asia and Israel presents with a right atrial pseudoaneurysm, new multifocal pulmonary nodules, CNS lesions, and sclerotic bone foci. Based on the differential discussed, which combination of factors strongly suggested Brucellosis as a potential diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Travel to Southeast Asia, eosinophilia, and pulmonary nodules",
        "Recent travel to Israel, bony lesions, neurologic manifestations, and pericardial involvement",
        "Strict Kosher diet, fishing hobby, and word-finding difficulty",
        "Prior hernia repair, pet dog exposure, and low-grade fevers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Recent travel to Israel, bony lesions, neurologic manifestations, and pericardial involvement",
      "rationale": "The speaker explicitly states that Brucellosis was on their differential 'given the Bony lesions the neurologic lesions and the paracardial involvement in the travel Israel' [T=1068]. The transcript also notes that there have been outbreaks of Brucellosis in Israel, making the travel history a key epidemiological link.",

    {
      "question": "According to the speaker's review of the literature, a cohort study from Stanford highlighted a common misdiagnosis for patients who ultimately had invasive mold infections. What was the initial, incorrect diagnosis for these patients?",

      "rationale": "The transcript references a specific 'interesting cohort study out of Stanford where they had 12 patients who had invasive molds who actually were initially diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer' [T=988-994]. This underscores the potential for fungal infections to mimic primary pulmonary malignancy.",

      "timestamp": 1243
    },
    {
      "question": "The final diagnosis in the presented case was angiosarcoma. The speaker noted that angiosarcoma itself is a great mimicker. Which of the following conditions was cited in the transcript as a presentation that can be mimicked by angiosarcoma?",

        "Viral meningitis",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Cellulitis of the scalp",
      "rationale": "The speaker reviews several ways angiosarcoma can mimic infection, including 'angio saroma mimicking cellulitis so people who initially were diagnosed with cellulitis of the scalp and facial cellulitis actually end up having contous angiosarcoma' [T=1284-1290].",
      "timestamp": 1285
    },
    {
      "question": "The speaker highlights 'Lesser known mimics' of malignancy. Which of the following pathogens, known for causing a wide spectrum from granulomatous lymphadenitis to bacillary angiomatosis, was placed in this specific category?",
      "options": [
        "Syphilis",
        "Mycobacterium tuberculosis",
        "Burkholderia pseudomallei",

      "correctAnswer": "Bartonella",
      "rationale": "The transcript introduces a distinct section for 'the Lesser known mimics' [T=1097] and the first organism discussed is 'bonella being on this list U mimicking different solid tumors like breast cancer lymphoma and saroma' [T=1103-1108]. Syphilis and Mycobacteria were classified as 'Great' mimics.",

      "rationale": "The speaker directly links the travel history to this specific parasite, stating: 'I was really interested in this patient about Paragon amasis given his travel to Southeast Asia' [T=1128-1131]. They further support this by citing a case report of pulmonary paragonimiasis 'mimicking a metastatic pulmonary tumor as well as mimicking an saroma' [T=1136-1142].",

      "timestamp": 1001
    },
    {
      "question": "Despite a comprehensive workup including BAL, CSF analysis, broad serologies, and Karius next-generation sequencing, the diagnosis remained elusive. What was the pivotal diagnostic procedure that yielded the final diagnosis of angiosarcoma?",

        "Biopsy of a sclerotic iliac bone focus",
        "Open lung biopsy of a pulmonary nodule",

      "rationale": "The transcript reveals the diagnostic turning point: 'so he underwent IR biopsy one of the paracardial lymph no you time to have angio sarcoma' [T=897-904]. This emphasizes the key learning point that 'tissue is the issue' when extensive non-invasive testing is negative.",
      "timestamp": 897

This inflammatory, eosinophil-rich picture contributed to the initial diagnostic uncertainty.",
