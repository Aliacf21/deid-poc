  "case_summary": "A 46-year-old male with a significant international travel history presents with recurrent chest pain, headache, and nausea two months after surgical repair of a right atrial pseudoaneurysm. At that time, pericardial fluid showed inflammatory cells and eosinophils. Current imaging reveals a multi-system process with new bilateral pulmonary nodules, pericardial masses, sclerotic bone foci, and multiple enhancing brain lesions. Lab work is notable for peripheral eosinophilia. The central challenge is to establish a unifying diagnosis for this complex, rapidly progressing condition.",

Categorize it into infectious, inflammatory, and malignant possibilities.",
