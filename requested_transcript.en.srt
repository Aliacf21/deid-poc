again I mean two months ago he had the

202
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:23,880
again I mean two months ago he had the
 

203
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,070
again I mean two months ago he had the
surgery two month ago he had the surgery

204
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
surgery two month ago he had the surgery
 

205
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,350
surgery two month ago he had the surgery
and he felt he recuperated or not yeah

206
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,360
and he felt he recuperated or not yeah
 

207
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,710
and he felt he recuperated or not yeah
he had some like low fevers after that

208
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
he had some like low fevers after that
 

209
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,629
he had some like low fevers after that
then had recovered traveled to Israel

210
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
then had recovered traveled to Israel
 

211
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,230
then had recovered traveled to Israel
had the workf finding difficulty and the

212
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,240
had the workf finding difficulty and the
 

213
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,909
had the workf finding difficulty and the
gate imbalance then returned and then

214
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
gate imbalance then returned and then
 

215
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,749
gate imbalance then returned and then
just a few days ago developed this acute

216
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:40,759
just a few days ago developed this acute
 

217
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,590
just a few days ago developed this acute
onset nausea and chest pain yeah yeah so

218
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
onset nausea and chest pain yeah yeah so
 

219
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,430
onset nausea and chest pain yeah yeah so
uh interesting and uh I I'd say a fairly

220
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
uh interesting and uh I I'd say a fairly
 

221
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,909
uh interesting and uh I I'd say a fairly
complicated case uh potentially but uh

222
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:52,919
complicated case uh potentially but uh
 

223
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,110
complicated case uh potentially but uh
oh oh manaw left the room okay all right

224
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,120
oh oh manaw left the room okay all right
 

225
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,670

we could either link or split but seems

we could either link or split but seems

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,150
we could either link or split but seems
likely related to the initial pathology

likely related to the initial pathology
 

261
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,590
likely related to the initial pathology
with sort of multifocal involvement um

262
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
with sort of multifocal involvement um

with both CNS disease and pulmonary

with both CNS disease and pulmonary
 

265
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,350
with both CNS disease and pulmonary
nodules and also Seth you did say there

266
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,360
nodules and also Seth you did say there
 

267
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,270
nodules and also Seth you did say there
was multiple paracardial soft tissue

268
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
was multiple paracardial soft tissue
 

269
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,189
was multiple paracardial soft tissue
lesions as well is that correct yeah

270
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
lesions as well is that correct yeah
 

271
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,110
lesions as well is that correct yeah
yeah he has some leion yeah masses and

272
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,120
yeah he has some leion yeah masses and
 

273
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,589
yeah he has some leion yeah masses and
his paric cardium as well and then some

00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:12,599
his paric cardium as well and then some

bones okay so widely

278
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
bones okay so widely
 

279
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,270

disseminated process um so I'm going to

280
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
disseminated process um so I'm going to
 

281
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,029
disseminated process um so I'm going to
just be upfront that I have absolutely

282
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
just be upfront that I have absolutely
 

283
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,070
just be upfront that I have absolutely
zero idea what this is but I will um try

284
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
zero idea what this is but I will um try
 

285
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,309
zero idea what this is but I will um try
to formulate some possible

286
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
to formulate some possible
 

287
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,189
to formulate some possible
possibilities so that we can do some

288
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:32,199
possibilities so that we can do some
 

289
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,909
possibilities so that we can do some
Diagnostics and then other people can

290
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
Diagnostics and then other people can
 

291
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,230
Diagnostics and then other people can
chime in I think as far just starting at

292
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,240
chime in I think as far just starting at
 

293
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,790
chime in I think as far just starting at
the beginning it seems unusual for a

294
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:39,800
the beginning it seems unusual for a
 

295
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,150
the beginning it seems unusual for a
standard bacterial process based on the

296
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,160
standard bacterial process based on the
 

297
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,550
standard bacterial process based on the
lack of initial perence or other

298
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:45,560
lack of initial perence or other
 

299
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,029
lack of initial perence or other
features and then the tempo of the

300
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
features and then the tempo of the
 

301
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,550
features and then the tempo of the
illness with the delay between the

302
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
illness with the delay between the
 

303
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,550
illness with the delay between the
initial repair and then

304
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
initial repair and then
 

305
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,230
initial repair and then
progression um I think some unusual more

306
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
progression um I think some unusual more
 

307
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,230
progression um I think some unusual more
standard bacterial types of organisms

308
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
standard bacterial types of organisms
 

309
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,469
standard bacterial types of organisms
that have more indolent courses like no

310
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
that have more indolent courses like no
 

311
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,790
that have more indolent courses like no
cardia can probably not avoid saying

312
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:01,800
cardia can probably not avoid saying
 

313
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,749
cardia can probably not avoid saying
with a pulmonary and CNS

314
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
with a pulmonary and CNS
 

315
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,309
with a pulmonary and CNS
presentation um it could also be the a

316
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:07,319
presentation um it could also be the a
 

317
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,510
presentation um it could also be the a
more occult bacterial infection with

318
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:10,520
more occult bacterial infection with
 

319
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,270
more occult bacterial infection with
brain abscesses from embolization and

320
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
brain abscesses from embolization and
 

321
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,350
brain abscesses from embolization and
and Pulmonary abses from the same so I

322
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,360
and Pulmonary abses from the same so I
 

323
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,029
and Pulmonary abses from the same so I
would put standard bacterial causes

324
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:18,039
would put standard bacterial causes

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,069
with one that would fit that um I mean
in my patients I always think of

in my patients I always think of
 

423
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,870
in my patients I always think of
toxoplasmosis which can cause both

toxoplasmosis which can cause both
 

425
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,389

pulmonary and CNS processes but I just

426
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
pulmonary and CNS processes but I just
 

427
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,590
pulmonary and CNS processes but I just
can't necessarily put that together here

428
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
can't necessarily put that together here
 

429
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,870
can't necessarily put that together here
um I'm sure there are other things I'm

430
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
um I'm sure there are other things I'm
 

431
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,949
um I'm sure there are other things I'm
leaving out there but I'll leave that

432
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:45,959
leaving out there but I'll leave that
 

433
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,269
leaving out there but I'll leave that
for someone else to fill in and then

434

for someone else to fill in and then
 

435
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,829
for someone else to fill in and then
viral ideologies um I I'm GNA leave that

436
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:52,839
viral ideologies um I I'm GNA leave that
 

437
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,430
viral ideologies um I I'm GNA leave that
one blank um because I I just can't put

438
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:56,440
one blank um because I I just can't put
 

439
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,750
one blank um because I I just can't put
one together but maybe someone else can

443
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,350
so I think uh because I'm just fling in
the dark I'll stop and let someone join

445
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,630
the dark I'll stop and let someone join
me thank you this is truly a strange

um anyone from the audience I I was U

452
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,200
um anyone from the audience I I was U
 

453
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,269
um anyone from the audience I I was U
sort of wondering so there was bone

454
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:20,279
sort of wondering so there was bone
 

455
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,829
sort of wondering so there was bone
there was

456
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
there was
 

457
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,509
there was
pericardial um there was brain and how

458
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:24,519
pericardial um there was brain and how
 

459
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,990
pericardial um there was brain and how
many brain uh lesions um at least three

460
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,000
many brain uh lesions um at least three
 

461
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,150
many brain uh lesions um at least three
yeah and with the bone I mean I was

462
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,160
yeah and with the bone I mean I was
 

463
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,190
yeah and with the bone I mean I was
thinking of some of the histiocytosis

464
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
thinking of some of the histiocytosis
 

465
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,990
thinking of some of the histiocytosis
syndromes which are usually more kids

466
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
syndromes which are usually more kids
 

467
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,110
syndromes which are usually more kids
what's that they just put the same yeah

468
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,120
what's that they just put the same yeah
 

469
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,910
what's that they just put the same yeah
you know there's all sorts of names

470
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
you know there's all sorts of names
 

471
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,230
you know there's all sorts of names
there um you know

472
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
there um you know
 

473
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,550
there um you know
leam H sugar schw or something that I've

474
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
leam H sugar schw or something that I've
 

475
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,069
leam H sugar schw or something that I've
since forgotten but the whole range of

476
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:49,079
since forgotten but the whole range of
 

477
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,870
since forgotten but the whole range of
those kind of macropod syndromes and I

478
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
those kind of macropod syndromes and I
 

479
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,670
those kind of macropod syndromes and I
was also just wondering about an immuno

480
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:52,680
was also just wondering about an immuno
 

481
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,949
was also just wondering about an immuno
deficiency state that would allow for

482
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:55,959
deficiency state that would allow for
 

483
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,069
deficiency state that would allow for
something like an NTM to have

484
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
something like an NTM to have
 

485
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,190
something like an NTM to have
dissemination we've seen

486
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,200
dissemination we've seen
 

487
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,750
dissemination we've seen
anti2

488
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
anti2
 

489
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,870
anti2
antibodies gamma interferon defects and

490
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
antibodies gamma interferon defects and
 

491
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,629
antibodies gamma interferon defects and
so on so some kind of

492
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:08,639
so on so some kind of
 

493
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,910
so on so some kind of
anti2 or gamma defect that might somehow

494
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
anti2 or gamma defect that might somehow
 

495
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,389
anti2 or gamma defect that might somehow
lead to a

496
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:13,399
lead to a
 

497
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:19,670
lead to a
predilection on that b but U and uh is

498
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
predilection on that b but U and uh is
 

499
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,670
predilection on that b but U and uh is
his background uh is he ashpazi you know

500
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
his background uh is he ashpazi you know
 

501
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,990
his background uh is he ashpazi you know
or I don't yeah I don't know

502
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,000
or I don't yeah I don't know
 

503
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,829
or I don't yeah I don't know
that FMF can call

504
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
that FMF can call
 

505
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,829
that FMF can call
serositis um you can get some tissue um

506
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:34,839
serositis um you can get some tissue um
 

507
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,509
serositis um you can get some tissue um
and odd presentation so I just wondering

508
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
and odd presentation so I just wondering
 

509
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,949
and odd presentation so I just wondering
a little bit about

510
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:39,959
a little bit about
 

511
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,910
a little bit about
that osis is that yes I'm add a couple

512
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
that osis is that yes I'm add a couple
 

513
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,110
that osis is that yes I'm add a couple
so um so M Matthew h is added the K

blasto coxy brella and then we even sent

608
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
blasto coxy brella and then we even sent
 

609
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,430
blasto coxy brella and then we even sent
out a carias Next Generation sequencing

610
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
out a carias Next Generation sequencing
 

611
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,749
out a carias Next Generation sequencing
on him which was negative as

612
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:54,759
on him which was negative as
 

613
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,870
on him which was negative as
well so he underwent IR biopsy one of

614
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:57,880
well so he underwent IR biopsy one of
 

615
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,910
well so he underwent IR biopsy one of
the paracardial lymph

616
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
the paracardial lymph
 

617
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,509
the paracardial lymph
no you time to have angio

618
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:04,519

 

619
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,189

saroma so thinking about this case and

620
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:08,199
saroma so thinking about this case and
 

621
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,030
saroma so thinking about this case and
there was a lot of he had been seen in

622
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,040
there was a lot of he had been seen in
 

623
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,710
there was a lot of he had been seen in
the outpatient sending by ID there had

624
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:11,720
the outpatient sending by ID there had
 

625
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,069
the outpatient sending by ID there had
been a lot of ID involvement I think

626
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:13,079
been a lot of ID involvement I think
 

627
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,110
been a lot of ID involvement I think
there was a lot of push for ID to come

628
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
there was a lot of push for ID to come
 

629
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,310
there was a lot of push for ID to come
up with a unifying differential

630
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:17,320
up with a unifying differential
 

631
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,749
up with a unifying differential
diagnosis but thinking about this case

632
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:19,759
diagnosis but thinking about this case
 

633
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,870
diagnosis but thinking about this case
one of the things that I wanted to kind

634
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
one of the things that I wanted to kind
 

635
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,150
one of the things that I wanted to kind
of learn from this and think more about

636
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
of learn from this and think more about
 

637
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,550
of learn from this and think more about
what are what infections are mimickers

638
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:23,560
what are what infections are mimickers
 

639
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,269
what are what infections are mimickers
of malignancy and then what malignancy

640
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
of malignancy and then what malignancy
 

641
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,069
of malignancy and then what malignancy
can mimic infection so in terms of

642
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
can mimic infection so in terms of
 

643
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,350
can mimic infection so in terms of
thinking about mimic I this is just

644
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
thinking about mimic I this is just

the great mimickers I think it's just

654
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
the great mimickers I think it's just
 

655
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,870
the great mimickers I think it's just
funny that we use this terminology a lot

656
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:41,880
funny that we use this terminology a lot
 

657
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,629
funny that we use this terminology a lot
that's very uh nons specific but in

658
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
that's very uh nons specific but in
 

659
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,910
that's very uh nons specific but in
terms of the great infectious mimickers

660
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:46,920
terms of the great infectious mimickers
 

661
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,389
terms of the great infectious mimickers
uh I broke this down kind of looking

662
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
uh I broke this down kind of looking
 

663
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,790
uh I broke this down kind of looking
through the literature and doing a

664
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:49,800
through the literature and doing a
 

665
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,110
through the literature and doing a
literature review to see what organisms

666
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,120
literature review to see what organisms
 

667
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,590

most comic most commonly are mimickers

668
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:54,600
most comic most commonly are mimickers
 

669
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,670
most comic most commonly are mimickers
for malignancy um and so these ones I'm

670
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:56,680
for malignancy um and so these ones I'm
 

671
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,069
for malignancy um and so these ones I'm
going to call the great infectious

672
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
going to call the great infectious
 

673
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,590
going to call the great infectious
mimickers I think

674
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
mimickers I think
 

675
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,670
mimickers I think
microbacteria being at the top of this

infections I think we all have a lot of

694
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:21,399
infections I think we all have a lot of
 

695
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,590

respect for um in terms of looking like

696
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:24,600
respect for um in terms of looking like
 

697
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,670

ozler who called syphilis the great
 

713
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,509
ozler who called syphilis the great
imitator um and I think it's something

714
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:44,519
imitator um and I think it's something
 

715
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,670

say I'll talk a little bit about where

818
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:32,840
say I'll talk a little bit about where
 

819
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,190

there 11 cases of MD Anderson that

820
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
there 11 cases of MD Anderson that
 

821
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,590
there 11 cases of MD Anderson that
initially had all been diagnosed as

initially had all been diagnosed as
 

823
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,870
initially had all been diagnosed as
cancer um but then came back and they

824
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
cancer um but then came back and they
 

825
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,029
cancer um but then came back and they
were actually

826
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:40,039
were actually
 

827
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,149
were actually
bonella um Helman infections um so uh

828
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:45,159
bonella um Helman infections um so uh
 

829
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,909
bonella um Helman infections um so uh
also can look like metastatic disease I

830
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:46,919
also can look like metastatic disease I
 

831
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,390

bacteria um but it can mimic lots of
 

903
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,230
bacteria um but it can mimic lots of
different um malignancies and this is

this interesting case um short study um
cohort study from MD Anderson they

908
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:16,520
cohort study from MD Anderson they
 

909
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,750
cohort study from MD Anderson they
looked at 11 cases um who were initially

910
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
looked at 11 cases um who were initially
 

911
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,789
looked at 11 cases um who were initially
been diagnosed with malignancy who

912
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
been diagnosed with malignancy who
 

913
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,549
been diagnosed with malignancy who
actually had cat scratch disease it was

914
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:25,559
actually had cat scratch disease it was
 

915
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,510
actually had cat scratch disease it was
interesting just kind of looking at the

916
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:26,520
interesting just kind of looking at the
 

917
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,710
interesting just kind of looking at the
demographics and exposures to cats um in

918
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:29,720
demographics and exposures to cats um in
 

919
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,350
demographics and exposures to cats um in
this cboard and then part of this thing

920
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
this cboard and then part of this thing
 

921
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,510
this cboard and then part of this thing
there's a literature review they look at

922
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:32,520
there's a literature review they look at
 

923
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,630
there's a literature review they look at
36 other cases where cat scratch disease

924
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
36 other cases where cat scratch disease
 

925
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,350
36 other cases where cat scratch disease
mimicked malignancy um and the kind of

926
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,360
mimicked malignancy um and the kind of
 

927
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,630
mimicked malignancy um and the kind of
overall similarities between these cases

928
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
overall similarities between these cases
 

929
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,230
overall similarities between these cases
is that a lot of them mimics lymphoma as

930
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,240
is that a lot of them mimics lymphoma as
 

931
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,990
is that a lot of them mimics lymphoma as
well as solid tumors in complely press

932
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,000
well as solid tumors in complely press
 

933
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,470
well as solid tumors in complely press
saroma and skin cancer um so it's kind

934
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
saroma and skin cancer um so it's kind
 

935
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,789
saroma and skin cancer um so it's kind
an interesting study to look at in open

936
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
an interesting study to look at in open
 

937
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,390
an interesting study to look at in open
form infectious

938

form infectious
 

939
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,510
form infectious
disease and then given this um case I

940
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
disease and then given this um case I
 

941
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,789
disease and then given this um case I
was also curious about what infections

942
00:20:59,789 --> 00:20:59,799
was also curious about what infections
 

943
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,789
was also curious about what infections
does angio sarcoma make I think it was

944
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:01,799
does angio sarcoma make I think it was
 

945
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,710
does angio sarcoma make I think it was
something that um it was unexpected and

946
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:05,720
something that um it was unexpected and
 

947
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,630
something that um it was unexpected and
I think important to think about going

948
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:07,640
I think important to think about going
 

949
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,830
I think important to think about going
forward as we try to expand our

950
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
forward as we try to expand our
 

951
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,710
forward as we try to expand our
differential so angio saroma I Comm make

952
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
differential so angio saroma I Comm make
 

953
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,070
differential so angio saroma I Comm make
lots of different infections there's an

of the scalp and facial cellulitis

966
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:29,159
of the scalp and facial cellulitis
 

967
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,950
of the scalp and facial cellulitis
actually end up having contous

968
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
actually end up having contous
 

969
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,710

angiosarcoma angara menum paric carditis

970
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:33,720
angiosarcoma angara menum paric carditis
 

971
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,230
angiosarcoma angara menum paric carditis
kind of like an our patient they had a

972
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,240
kind of like an our patient they had a
 

973
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,310
kind of like an our patient they had a
primary right atrium angio sacoma

974
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,320
primary right atrium angio sacoma
 

975
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,350
primary right atrium angio sacoma
similar to this patient mimicking

976
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
similar to this patient mimicking
 

977
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,870
similar to this patient mimicking
pericarditis and then an interesting

978
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:41,880
pericarditis and then an interesting
 

979
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,470
pericarditis and then an interesting
case report of angos sacoma mimicking

980
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
case report of angos sacoma mimicking
 

981
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,110
case report of angos sacoma mimicking
syphilis this was P SAR that was

982
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
syphilis this was P SAR that was
 

983
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,909
syphilis this was P SAR that was
initially misdiagnosed as syphilis so I

984
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
initially misdiagnosed as syphilis so I
 

985
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,870
initially misdiagnosed as syphilis so I
think just interesting things to keep in

986
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:51,880
think just interesting things to keep in
 

987
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,269
think just interesting things to keep in
mind um going forward thinking about our

988
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:55,279
mind um going forward thinking about our
 

989
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,750
mind um going forward thinking about our
differential so key points from this

990
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
differential so key points from this
 

991
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,950
differential so key points from this
case uh I think you can we could think

992
00:21:59,950 --> 00:21:59,960
case uh I think you can we could think
 

993
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,510
case uh I think you can we could think
about the great infectious disease

994
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,520
about the great infectious disease
 

995
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,310
about the great infectious disease
mimers and malignancy I think micob

996
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:03,320
mimers and malignancy I think micob
 

997
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,230
mimers and malignancy I think micob
bacteria fungal infection syphus forell

998
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
bacteria fungal infection syphus forell
 

999
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,750
bacteria fungal infection syphus forell
Anda my review would be the ones I would

1000
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:08,760
Anda my review would be the ones I would
 

1001
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,750
Anda my review would be the ones I would
put on here the Lesser known mimickers I

1002
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:10,760
put on here the Lesser known mimickers I
 

1003
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,029
put on here the Lesser known mimickers I
would include martinal helmouth

1004
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:12,039
would include martinal helmouth
 

1005
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,830
would include martinal helmouth
infections and no cardan

1006
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
infections and no cardan
 

1007
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,909
infections and no cardan
Nyes and I think one of the big learning

1008
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
Nyes and I think one of the big learning
 

1009
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,269
Nyes and I think one of the big learning
points from this case I think there were

1010
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:18,279
points from this case I think there were
 

1011
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,870
points from this case I think there were
some delays in diagnosis and treatment I

1012
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
some delays in diagnosis and treatment I
 

1013
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,269
some delays in diagnosis and treatment I
think this was initially had been kind

1014
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:22,279
think this was initially had been kind
 

1015
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,630
think this was initially had been kind
of misdiagnosed as a unknown infection

1016
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
of misdiagnosed as a unknown infection
 

1017
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,070
of misdiagnosed as a unknown infection
or rheumatologic sort of disease um

1018
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,080
or rheumatologic sort of disease um
 

1019
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,590
or rheumatologic sort of disease um
which led to delay ultimate diagnosis

1020
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
which led to delay ultimate diagnosis
 

1021
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,909
which led to delay ultimate diagnosis
and treatment and that angio saroma can

1022
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
and treatment and that angio saroma can
 

1023
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,830
and treatment and that angio saroma can
mimic multiple different

1024
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:34,840
mimic multiple different
 

1025
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,950
mimic multiple different
diseases these are the references

1026
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:37,960
diseases these are the references
 

1027
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,630
diseases these are the references
here great that was a nice overview I

1028
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:41,640
here great that was a nice overview I
 

1029
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,669
here great that was a nice overview I
think Charlotte just made a comment

1030
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
think Charlotte just made a comment
 

1031
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,950
think Charlotte just made a comment
saying noting LGB can mimic recal cancer

1032
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960

was there clinical correlation suggested

1042
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
was there clinical correlation suggested
 

1043
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,870
was there clinical correlation suggested
or were some of the nodules more

1044
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:05,880
or were some of the nodules more
 

1045
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,990
or were some of the nodules more
suggested malignancy or they're like

could be infectious could be malignancy

1048
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
could be infectious could be malignancy
 

1049
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,310
could be infectious could be malignancy
more of like could be infectious

1050
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:11,320
more of like could be infectious
 

1051
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,549
more of like could be infectious
malignancy um and it was really a lot of

1052
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:13,559
malignancy um and it was really a lot of
 

1053
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,269
malignancy um and it was really a lot of
coordination with International real

1054
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:15,279
coordination with International real
 

1055
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,549
coordination with International real
there was a great International realy so

1056
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
there was a great International realy so
 

1057
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,710
there was a great International realy so
we were able to get uh sample that note

1058
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:19,720
we were able to get uh sample that note
 

1059
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,029
we were able to get uh sample that note
and there was really it was actually

1060
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:22,039
and there was really it was actually
 

1061
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,149
and there was really it was actually
really remarkable we were talking like

1062
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:23,159
really remarkable we were talking like
 

1063
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:24,590
really remarkable we were talking like
late into the night so we got the path

1064
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,600
late into the night so we got the path
 

1065
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,350
late into the night so we got the path
back and he was talking that you the

1066
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:26,360
back and he was talking that you the
 

1067
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,269
back and he was talking that you the
diagnosis was made but uh took some and

1068
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:29,279
diagnosis was made but uh took some and
 

1069
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,350
diagnosis was made but uh took some and
they don't know where the primary is so

1070
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,360
they don't know where the primary is so
 

1071
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,510
they don't know where the primary is so
he suspect cardiac so so his prognosis

1072
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:34,520
he suspect cardiac so so his prognosis
 

1073
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,070
he suspect cardiac so so his prognosis
is not very

1074
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
is not very
 

1075
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,269
is not very
good

empiric antibiotics uh during this or
 

1081
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,950
empiric antibiotics uh during this or
was yeah that was held off as diagnostic

out to the team obtain the specimens

1094
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:03,159
out to the team obtain the specimens
 

1095
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:04,630
out to the team obtain the specimens
made sure that they all into the labs

1096
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
made sure that they all into the labs
 

1097
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,029
made sure that they all into the labs
appropriately amazing team efforts yeah

1098
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,039
appropriately amazing team efforts yeah
 

1099
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,350
appropriately amazing team efforts yeah
often in these complex cases it really

1100
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:10,360
often in these complex cases it really
 

1101
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,950
often in these complex cases it really
is good communication and coordination

1102
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
is good communication and coordination
 

1103
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,430
is good communication and coordination
is important I we've filed a number of

1104
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:16,440
is important I we've filed a number of
 

1105
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,630
is important I we've filed a number of
um things when things you know you've

1106
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
um things when things you know you've
 

1107
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,549
um things when things you know you've
asked for things but they don't get sent

1108
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
asked for things but they don't get sent
 

1109
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,590
asked for things but they don't get sent
and of course it's a surgical sample so

1110
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
and of course it's a surgical sample so
 

1111
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,110
and of course it's a surgical sample so
to go back is a big deal so it's good to

1112
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,120
to go back is a big deal so it's good to
 

1113
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,350
to go back is a big deal so it's good to
have that all on board ahead of time

1114
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
have that all on board ahead of time
 

1115
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,750
have that all on board ahead of time
any other comments um and I think your

1116
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:32,760
any other comments um and I think your
 

1117
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,389
any other comments um and I think your
points about looking at it from both

1118
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:34,399
points about looking at it from both
 

1119
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:37,350
points about looking at it from both
ways uh are really important I think at

1120
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
ways uh are really important I think at
 

1121
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,710
ways uh are really important I think at
least for our patient what we get seen

1122
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,720
least for our patient what we get seen
 

1123
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,830
least for our patient what we get seen

the most is the lump um and where you
 

1125
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,430
the most is the lump um and where you
know lump tumors and smokers are removed

1126
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:46,440
know lump tumors and smokers are removed
 

1127
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,389

because of a positive pet scan turns out

Mai something of that nature and that's
 

1133
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,029

the others I think as you said are war

1138
00:24:59,470 --> 00:24:59,480
the others I think as you said are war
 

1139

so hi stth this is zene um thanks for

1142
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,120
so hi stth this is zene um thanks for
 

1143
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,630
so hi stth this is zene um thanks for
that case and also for um I think one of

1144
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,640
that case and also for um I think one of
 

1145
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,510
that case and also for um I think one of
the things we most of us love so much

1146
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:10,520
the things we most of us love so much
 

1147
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,510
the things we most of us love so much
about IDE is that we always stay even if

1148
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:12,520
about IDE is that we always stay even if
 

1149
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,510
about IDE is that we always stay even if
it doesn't look like it's our problem um

1150
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
it doesn't look like it's our problem um
 

1151
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,789
it doesn't look like it's our problem um
I wonder about the use of pet in these

1152
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:17,799
I wonder about the use of pet in these
 

1153
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,789
I wonder about the use of pet in these
cases not just to look for avidity but

1154
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:19,799
cases not just to look for avidity but
 

1155
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,870
cases not just to look for avidity but
to look for intensity and I know that in

1156
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:21,880
to look for intensity and I know that in
 

1157
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,549
to look for intensity and I know that in
some time case settings that is useful

1158
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:24,559
some time case settings that is useful
 

1159
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,710
some time case settings that is useful
with like known

1160
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:25,720
with like known
 

1161
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,789
with like known
malignancies but I don't know how good

1162
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:27,799
malignancies but I don't know how good
 

1163
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,909
malignancies but I don't know how good
we're getting at differentiating whether

1164
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
we're getting at differentiating whether
 

1165
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,350
we're getting at differentiating whether
something looks like an indolent

1166
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
something looks like an indolent
 

1167
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,630
something looks like an indolent
infection versus an aggressive

1168
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:33,640
infection versus an aggressive
 

1169
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,310
infection versus an aggressive
malignancy just because these syndromes

1170
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
malignancy just because these syndromes
 

1171
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,149
malignancy just because these syndromes
are so hard and here obviously there was

1172
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:39,159
are so hard and here obviously there was
 

1173
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:42,029
are so hard and here obviously there was
some accessible tissue and that really

1174
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:42,039
some accessible tissue and that really
 

1175
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,190
some accessible tissue and that really
helped but in cases where there's not I

1176
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,200
helped but in cases where there's not I
 

1177
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,870
helped but in cases where there's not I
do still think we need tools to try and

1178
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:45,880
do still think we need tools to try and
 

1179
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:57,070
do still think we need tools to try and
sort out infection versus things like

1180
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,080

 

1181
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,190

malignancy hey well thanks I that's a

1182
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,200
malignancy hey well thanks I that's a
 

1183
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,470
malignancy hey well thanks I that's a
that's a great Point any other

1184
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,480
that's a great Point any other
 

1185
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,990
that's a great Point any other
comments the ACs is happy that no one

1186
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,000
comments the ACs is happy that no one
 

1187
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,590
comments the ACs is happy that no one
here got it

1188
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:07,600

 

1189
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,029

either well angio sarcomas are a

1190
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
either well angio sarcomas are a
 

1191
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,470
either well angio sarcomas are a
notoriously difficult tumor because they

1192
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:13,480
notoriously difficult tumor because they
 

1193
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,789
notoriously difficult tumor because they
will not I mean a lot of times they'll

1194
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:15,799
will not I mean a lot of times they'll
 

1195
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,190
will not I mean a lot of times they'll
have Regional spread in a limb but if

1196
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
have Regional spread in a limb but if
 

1197
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,950
have Regional spread in a limb but if
they're occurring elsewhere can be very

1198
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:21,960
they're occurring elsewhere can be very
 

1199
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,990
they're occurring elsewhere can be very
difficult to to diagnose and I guess in

1200
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
difficult to to diagnose and I guess in
 

1201
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,750
difficult to to diagnose and I guess in
retrospect the thought was somehow that

1202
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:26,760
retrospect the thought was somehow that
 

1203
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,190
retrospect the thought was somehow that
process was part of the pseudo ISM but

1204
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
process was part of the pseudo ISM but
 

1205
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,750
process was part of the pseudo ISM but
just wasn't pathologically identified

1206
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:31,760
just wasn't pathologically identified
 

1207
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,870
just wasn't pathologically identified
yeah yeah rapidly Progressive right

1208
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:35,880
yeah yeah rapidly Progressive right
 

1209
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,789
yeah yeah rapidly Progressive right
right yeah unfortunately some of them

1210
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:37,799
right yeah unfortunately some of them
 

1211
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,310
right yeah unfortunately some of them
are treatment's really terrible and it's

1212
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
are treatment's really terrible and it's
 

1213
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,310
are treatment's really terrible and it's
usually radiation yeah that's what he's

1214
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,320
usually radiation yeah that's what he's
 

1215
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,750
usually radiation yeah that's what he's
scheduled for

1216
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:44,760
scheduled for
