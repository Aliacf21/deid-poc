welcome all the fellowship applicat I'm SE one of the adult I fellows and just
go through slides here no disclosures the title of my talk isim we have a 46y
old male with history of right atrial pseudo aneurysm rupture that underwent
repair it had pericarditis with a pericardial Fusion who's now presenting with
recurrent chest pain and heada so two months prior to this admission this
patient was hospitalized with chest pain and low braid fevers he was found to
have a pseudo aneurysm protruding from the right atrium in paric carditis and
underwent Bine patch repair or cultures of the pseudo aneurysm were negative
cytopathology of the paracardial fluid showed some mixed inflammatory cells with
numerous eosinophils reactive mesothelial cells histiocytes and pyes he was
discharged after this repair and hospitalization with ID and Rheumatology
followup for further work up of what could have been causing this um he was
being worked up in the outpatient study and then he went to Israel 10 days ago
and while he was there developed some word finding difficulty and was noticed by
his wife to have an unsteady date uh he's returning from this trip now with
worsening left-sided chest pain headache and NAA in terms of his past medical
history um he had this atrial pseudo aneurysm also had a herni repair in the
past it's the medications that he's on no allergies he lives in Maryland um his
occupation is he sells furniture and he travels a lot for he's traveled to
Malaysia China and Vietnam in the last two years to visit factories he's been
both in rural and urban settings he traveled to Cancun six months ago for
vacation I he keeps a pretty strict Kosher diet um he has a prior smoking
history he enjoys fishing catch and release only uh he has a pet dog uh his
brother owns some exotic birds and a pet lizard and his daughter likes to ride
horses uh he is monogamous with his wife when we see him um his vitals are
within normal limits he's a Feb s while room air he's just very uncomfortable
appearing very nauseous um kind of in the process of having some emesis he uh is
uh Conjuring TAA are clear his heart sounds normal lung some normal AB is fairly
benign um his neur oxium there's nothing focal on his nerves and rashes in terms
of his labs labs are fairly unremarkable he doesn't have a lucco yosis he's a
little bit anemic um he does have a slight elevation his percent of eosinophil
on his diff um and then his BMP is fairly unremarkable his Imaging those he
under go a CT chest abam and pelv with contrast and now there are multiple
bilateral solid pulmonary nodules with surrounding Halo these are new from two
months ago when he was seen he has a prominent subsidary left cardiophrenic
angle lymph node and prominent right higher node he has numerous soft tissue
masses in the parac cardium and then ated subcentimeter scerotic osus fosi in
the left femur and in the bilateral iliac bones he's also found to have multiple
enhancing lesions in the temporal lobe left anterior Thalamus right parial lobe
with paranal Hemorrhage and surrounding vasogenic EMA lesions shown here so we
have a 46y old male with a issue of right atrial cism underw rupture and repair
paric carditis paracardial Fusion is's presenting with recurrent chest ping to
to have new pulmonary nodules and cerebral lesions appreciate help with the
differential diagnosis right right oops oh stop sharing interesting um situation
here in a person that seems to be relatively healthy and and over what time
frame uh were these symptoms again I mean two months ago he had the surgery two
month ago he had the surgery and he felt he recuperated or not yeah he had some
like low fevers after that then had recovered traveled to Israel had the workf
finding difficulty and the gate imbalance then returned and then just a few days
ago developed this acute onset nausea and chest pain yeah yeah so uh interesting
and uh I I'd say a fairly complicated case uh potentially but uh oh oh manaw
left the room okay all right so so uh um okay I'm going to move on from there a
little bit um let's see here um Eileen Scully are you available to give us some
initial thoughts on this interesting presentation sorry about that sure thank
you had trouble unmuting as we all say um so this is a 46 year old with an
extensive travel history and a prior unclear ideology um pseudoaneurysm which
had some inflammatory features for which it sounds like there was an open
infectious versus inflammatory differential who's now representing with
progression that we could either link or split but seems likely related to the
initial pathology with sort of multifocal involvement um with both CNS disease
and pulmonary nodules and also Seth you did say there was multiple paracardial
soft tissue lesions as well is that correct yeah yeah he has some leion yeah
masses and his paric cardium as well and then some sportic fosi and his femur
and his iliac bones okay so widely disseminated process um so I'm going to just
be upfront that I have absolutely zero idea what this is but I will um try to
formulate some possible possibilities so that we can do some Diagnostics and
then other people can chime in I think as far just starting at the beginning it
seems unusual for a standard bacterial process based on the lack of initial
perence or other features and then the tempo of the illness with the delay
between the initial repair and then progression um I think some unusual more
standard bacterial types of organisms that have more indolent courses like no
cardia can probably not avoid saying with a pulmonary and CNS presentation um it
could also be the a more occult bacterial infection with brain abscesses from
embolization and and Pulmonary abses from the same so I would put standard
bacterial causes there maybe I don't know something with the lower virulence
like anoxi or um one of the nutrition nutritionally deficient strep species but
um and I suppose you always have to say just standard staff and strap although
this just seems very um unlikely I think much more plausible seems to be
something like an atypical process which on which I would include microbacterial
infection um again with the multi-stem involvement uh relatively occult to
diagnose is kind of a process although I don't think of that as being associated
with pseudoaneurysms alth I wish mon was here to correct me on on that um as
also um I don't know and maybe at least is here is if there's a particular NTM
that has a vascular predilection um so then other less common bacterial
processes would they be like um the uh birkhold area mosis type of presentation
with his travel to Southeast Asia and other locations where that's endemic um
and then another a typical bacterial um associated with vascular presentation
would be syphilis although having a really hard time um imagining how that's
related to the CNS and lung lesions moving on from that uh fungal pathogens I
think um cidio micosis is occasionally associated with pericarditis um it sounds
like he's got sort of Plenty Of Travel such that histoplasmosis and other things
he's probably been in mic areas crypticus certainly can cause cryptococcomas and
CNS presentations um with this degree of dissemination and an IMO compromised
host seems unlikely but I'll I'll leave it up there and then I have no idea if
blast micosis could do this but I guess I will just add it to the list um other
processes like parasitic infections or or things of that nature um I am having a
hard time coming up with one that would fit that um I mean in my patients I
always think of toxoplasmosis which can cause both pulmonary and CNS processes
but I just can't necessarily put that together here um I'm sure there are other
things I'm leaving out there but I'll leave that for someone else to fill in and
then viral ideologies um I I'm GNA leave that one blank um because I I just
can't put one together but maybe someone else can so I think uh because I'm just
fling in the dark I'll stop and let someone join me thank you this is truly a
strange case and thanks for starting off with some really uh important
considerations um anyone from the audience I I was U sort of wondering so there
was bone there was pericardial um there was brain and how many brain uh lesions
um at least three yeah and with the bone I mean I was thinking of some of the
histiocytosis syndromes which are usually more kids what's that they just put
the same yeah you know there's all sorts of names there um you know leam H sugar
schw or something that I've since forgotten but the whole range of those kind of
macropod syndromes and I was also just wondering about an immuno deficiency
state that would allow for something like an NTM to have dissemination we've
seen anti2 antibodies gamma interferon defects and so on so some kind of anti2
or gamma defect that might somehow lead to a predilection on that b but U and uh
is his background uh is he ashpazi you know or I don't yeah I don't know that
FMF can call serositis um you can get some tissue um and odd presentation so I
just wondering a little bit about that osis is that yes I'm add a couple so um
so M Matthew h is added the K caucus Dave igg4 yeah this would go under NTM but
Bill just specifically guess the cular surgery yeah Mar theosis iosis there's oh
an IGG or yeah disease like a pseudo tumor kind yeah so adding atino okay and
asilis and then eth is going to add salmonella pudus hello hello hello Seth how
are we doing up here not up there not up there we add bruella okay okay I'm
sorry yes I was saying the brosis okay it sounds like the well is dry is it up
there now still not up there all right this is our first stump of the academic
this is you stumped the CHS all of us so but thanks this is a tough one for sure
I assume saying Rus but I'm just gonna say I also know okay I I uh I think this
is where tissue is the issue right so but highly interesting presentation thank
you uh Eileen for taking us through this for being the first chump no we're all
Chumps perplexed by this and there were a lot of lot of teams involved so in
terms of infectious workouts we underwent a BAL with lung biopsy the lung biopsy
just showed alveolated lung parena with focal organizing pneumonia bacterial
fungal and AFB cultures had no growth they did a gene expert that was negative
also did an OM on his which was negative CSF was clear there were no white blood
cells the glucose and the protein were unremarkable and the CSF work was
negative as well the crypto bacterial fungal AFB VL H6 JC virus VB HSV were all
negative in terms of his blood and serology work up negative t-spot his fungle
markers were all negative uh checked a lot of different things like Q fever toxo
stry HIV Bella blasto coxy brella and then we even sent out a carias Next
Generation sequencing on him which was negative as well so he underwent IR
biopsy one of the paracardial lymph no you time to have angio saroma so thinking
about this case and there was a lot of he had been seen in the outpatient
sending by ID there had been a lot of ID involvement I think there was a lot of
push for ID to come up with a unifying differential diagnosis but thinking about
this case one of the things that I wanted to kind of learn from this and think
more about what are what infections are mimickers of malignancy and then what
malignancy can mimic infection so in terms of thinking about mimic I this is
just funny if you H Med search the great mimer there's over 2,000 articles
ranging from people talking about malignancy to covid-19 to the EKG being the
great mimickers I think it's just funny that we use this terminology a lot
that's very uh nons specific but in terms of the great infectious mimickers uh I
broke this down kind of looking through the literature and doing a literature
review to see what organisms most comic most commonly are mimickers for
malignancy um and so these ones I'm going to call the great infectious mimickers
I think microbacteria being at the top of this list um you know really
suspicious for you know findings that can look like metastatic disease pulmonary
malignancy for example there was a cohort study out of Japan where there were 16
out of 460 patients who were initially diagnosed with pulmonary malignancy or
later were diagnosed with microbacteria Bal fungal infections I think we all
have a lot of respect for um in terms of looking like metastatic disease as well
this was an interesting cohort study out of Stanford where they had 12 patients
who had invasive molds who actually were initially diagnosed with non- small
cell lung cancer um so fungal infections being involved syphilis I think it was
ozler who called syphilis the great imitator um and I think it's something we
think less about now but I think can look like a lot of different types of
malignancy R from rectal cancer to cutaneous malignancy or metastatic disease
this isn't citation of an interesting case report where secondary syphilis
mimicked a lympo proliferate disorder lymphoma the pet scan for is really
remarkable and it looks like the patient has but actually had second par
syphilis brosis talk a little bit about I think was interesting in this case for
me at least with the travel to Israel and then CNS uh manifestations bone
manifestations and you know looking like potentially paracardial marment
metastatic disease there's an interesting case report of a patient from Peru had
neuro brosis that mimiced a CNS tumor that was initially misdiagnosed and then
bul bold area or mosis something that we had talked about on the differential
also you know depending on exposur to something that can look like metastatic
disease or in the case report bronchogenic carcinoma for brucelosis I thought
this was interesting was something that was on my differential when I saw him
given the Bony lesions the neurologic lesions and the paracardial involvement in
the travel Israel there have been outbreaks of brosis in Israel and this was
something that I was working on with um Peter re at the University of Washington
and the center for one Health there so there have been some outbreaks of
brucelosis there and then this interesting case report of neurosis that I was
mentioning as well but this patient had a really strict Kosher diet and his
brosis serology was unremarkable then the Lesser known mimics I'm going to call
these I think are ones that are also important to think about but don't come up
in the literature quite as often bonella being on this list U mimicking
different solid tumors like breast cancer lymphoma and saroma there's an
interesting um cohort say I'll talk a little bit about where there 11 cases of
MD Anderson that initially had all been diagnosed as cancer um but then came
back and they were actually bonella um Helman infections um so uh also can look
like metastatic disease I was really interested in this patient about Paragon
amasis given his travel to Southeast Asia there's an interesting case report of
pulmonary paragonimiasis mimicking a metastatic pulmonary tumor as well as
mimicking an saroma um and so with his cardiac pulmonary and CNS involvement
thought that parag was interesting and we had the OM on the B that was negative
no cardia and actinomyces um which was also on the differential again things
that can be kind of indolence and mimic metastatic disease and this is this
interesting case report about three cases of pulmonary nocardia with cerebral
abses that lung cancer so in terms of of Bartonella um I think the history does
Bella had a particular fondness for was the first organism that I studied um I
see with San Falon Lucy Tomkins and they share with me kind of their discovery
of bartella as the agent for Basel angiomatosis so we know bartella can Celli
can cause a Gran this lym fattis so cat scratch disease or the vascular
proliferation billar angiomatosis that we see in IMO compromised patients
initially they thought maybe it was AET seal organism this was kind of you know
in the early days of DNA and sequencing things like that that they were then
able to identify it um as spens Al as a bacteria um but it can mimic lots of
different um malignancies and this is this interesting case um short study um
cohort study from MD Anderson they looked at 11 cases um who were initially been
diagnosed with malignancy who actually had cat scratch disease it was
interesting just kind of looking at the demographics and exposures to cats um in
this cboard and then part of this thing there's a literature review they look at
36 other cases where cat scratch disease mimicked malignancy um and the kind of
overall similarities between these cases is that a lot of them mimics lymphoma
as well as solid tumors in complely press saroma and skin cancer um so it's kind
an interesting study to look at in open form infectious disease and then given
this um case I was also curious about what infections does angio sarcoma make I
think it was something that um it was unexpected and I think important to think
about going forward as we try to expand our differential so angio saroma I Comm
make lots of different infections there's an interesting case report of a of Ang
M infected aneurysm and pseudo aneurysm um in the abdominal aorta angio saroma
mimicking cellulitis so people who initially were diagnosed with cellulitis of
the scalp and facial cellulitis actually end up having contous angiosarcoma
angara menum paric carditis kind of like an our patient they had a primary right
atrium angio sacoma similar to this patient mimicking pericarditis and then an
interesting case report of angos sacoma mimicking syphilis this was P SAR that
was initially misdiagnosed as syphilis so I think just interesting things to
keep in mind um going forward thinking about our differential so key points from
this case uh I think you can we could think about the great infectious disease
mimers and malignancy I think micob bacteria fungal infection syphus forell Anda
my review would be the ones I would put on here the Lesser known mimickers I
would include martinal helmouth infections and no cardan Nyes and I think one of
the big learning points from this case I think there were some delays in
diagnosis and treatment I think this was initially had been kind of misdiagnosed
as a unknown infection or rheumatologic sort of disease um which led to delay
ultimate diagnosis and treatment and that angio saroma can mimic multiple
different diseases these are the references here great that was a nice overview
I think Charlotte just made a comment saying noting LGB can mimic recal cancer
and uh with HIV as an example of bacteria mimicking so Seth I mean given the
bindings often the radi ologists help uh was there clinical correlation
suggested or were some of the nodules more suggested malignancy or they're like
could be infectious could be malignancy more of like could be infectious
malignancy um and it was really a lot of coordination with International real
there was a great International realy so we were able to get uh sample that note
and there was really it was actually really remarkable we were talking like late
into the night so we got the path back and he was talking that you the diagnosis
was made but uh took some and they don't know where the primary is so he suspect
cardiac so so his prognosis is not very good yeah any uh any questions did he
get empiric antibiotics uh during this or was yeah that was held off as
diagnostic workout was yeah was he on the medicine service or he yes the Giants
okay what is it right right what did Kelly uh Kelly just saying huge shout out
to the team obtain the specimens made sure that they all into the labs
appropriately amazing team efforts yeah often in these complex cases it really
is good communication and coordination is important I we've filed a number of um
things when things you know you've asked for things but they don't get sent and
of course it's a surgical sample so to go back is a big deal so it's good to
have that all on board ahead of time any other comments um and I think your
points about looking at it from both ways uh are really important I think at
least for our patient what we get seen the most is the lump um and where you
know lump tumors and smokers are removed because of a positive pet scan turns
out to be Mai something of that nature and that's probably the number one mimic
or actinomycosis is pretty rare than all the others I think as you said are war
in the case report territory so hi stth this is zene um thanks for that case and
also for um I think one of the things we most of us love so much about IDE is
that we always stay even if it doesn't look like it's our problem um I wonder
about the use of pet in these cases not just to look for avidity but to look for
intensity and I know that in some time case settings that is useful with like
known malignancies but I don't know how good we're getting at differentiating
whether something looks like an indolent infection versus an aggressive
malignancy just because these syndromes are so hard and here obviously there was
some accessible tissue and that really helped but in cases where there's not I
do still think we need tools to try and sort out infection versus things like
malignancy hey well thanks I that's a that's a great Point any other comments
the ACs is happy that no one here got it either well angio sarcomas are a
notoriously difficult tumor because they will not I mean a lot of times they'll
have Regional spread in a limb but if they're occurring elsewhere can be very
difficult to to diagnose and I guess in retrospect the thought was somehow that
process was part of the pseudo ISM but just wasn't pathologically identified
yeah yeah rapidly Progressive right right yeah unfortunately some of them are
treatment's really terrible and it's usually radiation yeah that's what he's
scheduled for yeah okay well thanks very much I look forward to meeting um a few
uh of our interviewees today I hope you have a great day here virtually in
Baltimore and at John's Hopkins and thank you all for coming in person so until
next Tuesday
